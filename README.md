# Week 2 Diagnostic

<!-- MATERIALS METADATA -->
<!--
  title: 'R2D2 Week 2 Diagnostic'
  type: diagnostic
  creators: Matt Brendzel
  competencies: javascript, functions, problem solving
-->

## Setup

Make sure that you are on the `master` branch of your `wdi-remote-r2d2` repo.
Then run `git pull upstream master` to pull the latest materials from the
instructors' repository. You shouldn't hit a merge conflict here, but if you do,
flag down an instructor right away.

Next, navigate to the directory for today, go into the `diagnostic` directory,
and run `npm install` -- this will download any assignment-specific JavaScript
dependencies into to a directory called `node_modules`.

## Instructions

Read through `diagnostic.js` and complete all of the functions listed there.

### Testing Your Work

As usual, a set of automated [Mocha.js](https://mochajs.org/) tests have been
provided for you. You can run these tests by running `npm test` from within the
`diagnostic` directory.

Remember: test your work regularly, and read the feedback from the tests
carefully. It may give you a clue about what to do next.

## Submitting Your Work

When you're ready to submit your work, push the code to your fork on GitHub.
Then, create an issue on the `wdi-remote-...` repo using the same convention
as before: "YourGitHubUsername -- Week 02 Diagnostic". Run the test
suite one last time, take a screenshot of the output, and paste that screenshot
into the issue's body. Please also include a link that points back to the code
on your fork.
